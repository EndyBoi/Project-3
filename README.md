# Project 3 - API

This is the third project of four for Ironhack's web development boot-camp. In particular, this will be based around the usage of publicly accessible API. For this project I will be using the following sources:

```sh
https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
https://github.com/evz/tacofancy-api
https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes
https://streetfoodapp.com/api
```

## Building and running on localhost

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```
